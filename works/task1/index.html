    <h2>Expectation document</h2>
    <p> I am having good experience in india as a frontend developer used to develop mobile applications using React
        Native
        so i have chosen frontend as my career. By taking this course, it will help me to again gain more knowledge and
        good hands-on skills from scratch
        By the end of the course, I aim to develop my own application from scratch to deployment level, and this course
        will benefit me in achieving my career plan to become a frontend developer, and I want to learn tools like the
        React framework and become a pro in it, which helps me to pursue good job opportunities.

        Thankyou</p>
